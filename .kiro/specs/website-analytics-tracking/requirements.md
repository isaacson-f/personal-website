# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive analytics tracking system for a static HTML website that collects detailed visitor data including URL hashes, user interactions, and behavioral patterns. The system maintains the website's HTML-only frontend while adding robust backend analytics capabilities to gather insights about visitor behavior and traffic patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to collect comprehensive visitor analytics data, so that I can understand user behavior and optimize my website performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor loads any page THEN the system SHALL capture the full URL including hash fragments
2. WHEN a visitor navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL track the navigation path and timing
3. WHEN a visitor interacts with page elements THEN the system SHALL record click events and element identifiers
4. WHEN a visitor scrolls on a page THEN the system SHALL track scroll depth and engagement time
5. WHEN a visitor's session begins THEN the system SHALL capture browser information and referrer data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to track detailed user session information, so that I can analyze visitor patterns and demographics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new visitor arrives THEN the system SHALL generate a unique session identifier
2. WHEN collecting visitor data THEN the system SHALL capture IP address, user agent, timestamp, and geographic location
3. WHEN a visitor returns THEN the system SHALL identify returning visitors using browser fingerprinting techniques
4. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL calculate total session duration and page views
5. IF a visitor has JavaScript disabled THEN the system SHALL still collect basic analytics via server-side tracking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want a backend system to store and process analytics data, so that I can generate reports and insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analytics data is collected THEN the system SHALL store it in a structured database format
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate entries
3. WHEN processing analytics THEN the system SHALL provide real-time data aggregation capabilities
4. WHEN accessing analytics THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for data retrieval
5. WHEN handling high traffic THEN the system SHALL maintain performance and scalability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want privacy-compliant analytics tracking, so that I can collect data while respecting visitor privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting personal data THEN the system SHALL implement data anonymization techniques
2. WHEN a visitor opts out THEN the system SHALL respect do-not-track preferences
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL implement data retention policies
4. WHEN handling sensitive information THEN the system SHALL encrypt data in transit and at rest
5. IF required by jurisdiction THEN the system SHALL provide data deletion capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want minimal impact on website performance, so that analytics tracking doesn't affect user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading analytics code THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous loading to prevent blocking
2. WHEN tracking events THEN the system SHALL batch requests to minimize server calls
3. WHEN the analytics service is unavailable THEN the website SHALL continue functioning normally
4. WHEN implementing tracking THEN the system SHALL add minimal JavaScript footprint
5. WHEN collecting data THEN the system SHALL use efficient data transmission methods
