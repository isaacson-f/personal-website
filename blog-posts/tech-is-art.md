Hi. if you've stumbled onto this page and somehow don't know me, I'm Frank, Francis, Frankie whatever you want to call me (albeit i've learned this is worse than just giving one option). 

Austin Butler once said in an instagram reel that cringe is an unexplored emotion, and that really resonated with me, so here we are.

# Tech is art, art is the goal

I started as a builder. Didn't even think about it at the time, which I suppose most builders don't. Half the time the inventions provided "value" *oof yuck feel nasty just saying that* about a young me's excitement over his *stink machine*, *hotdog maker*, *air-dry clay with alumninum foil sticking out*, *multi-tiered dam in a small babbling brook built for catching fish*, *taser made from those bug zapper tennis rackets*, *over-engineered igloos with custom-ice windows and chimney toppers*, *hot air blower*, *cool glass acorn in oil in old peanut butter jar*, *JAM*, *door-to-door lemonade selling*, and *Pottery shed & various custom tools just to make it work* to name a few. 

I like(d) to make stuff. Providing shareholder value is a whole new world of building, one of which I've been grappling with personally having entered the workforce this past February, joining a small 5 person team at a startup called Deasy Labs. 

Faster than i expected gone were the days of other people (mainly my parents thanks mom and dad) getting excited over my miscelanneous semi-useful inventions. This is truly not a unique feeling anymore, especially from those entering the workforce without the vaunted Northeastern co-op program exposing them to arguably the best part of the corporate world, the intern section.

In came the days of meeting deadlines set by other people, the need to trust somebody else's vision, and grinding it out. Naturally, this caused a certain amount of dissonance, many solo walks were taken creating through drawing (something i find mildly interesting I suppose, and it has grown on me). 

Through this drawing i felt the familiar escape of building worlds, characters, figures that only needed to be meaningful to me, and re-awoke my desire to get back to my roots of pottery and physically building something with my hands. I fear i will never get back to the free-flowing building of my youth, as building the studio you work in requires a privilege of time that I felt lucky to have yet lack now. 

Art under restriction is a controversial topic to some, however, for me, it's quite cut and dry. Some of the best art pieces in history have been made under restrictions that i'm sure many artists would complain and gripe about, but it forces them to adapt and move outside the comfy cozy zone their art has been existing. Take the sistine chapel for example, Michelangelo had to paint a fucking ceiling for hours in the most awkward positions known to man, and that is one of the reasons the piece is beautiful. It adds context, a pilgramage of sorts, which makes even those not fully appreciative of art to realize as a feat of man. I've come to view coding and tech work as art under restriction, as I must to hold an obsession with it required for starting a company in todays fast paced AI world.

Think about it. Code As Art. CAA if you want to get fancy and give it an acronym. The beautiful part of this is this means something different to everyone involved at different steps of the development. Product managers see user flows and customer value as art, backend engineers often are more focused on the art of data flowing in and out of classes they designed as art, frontend engineers a bit more literally see a responsive and satisfying web page as art. Each developer under different restriction, whether that be organizational rules set in place when typescript didn't exist, or just the general restriction of needing the medium to be code. Every person is an artist with a different interpretation of their craft and output, with the stipulation that somebody else has enough appreciation for it that they're willing to pay.

Now, i know you're thinking "oh what about all the other professions". Ah yes, the vaunted 9-5. Of which draws so much ire within San Francisco and other bustling cities where new-age hustle and startup culture have such a strong grip on. As a current 9-6ish worker, I truly do believe there is still art in every job known to man. Everyone's craft is different. Maybe one persons idea of the perfect piece, crafted meticulously from quarter to quarter is getting promoted in next year of a huge corporations promotional cycle, while another's is just getting by while doing exactly 1 hour of work a day. Both artists in their own right, under the circumstances provided, from their own perspectives. Crafting daily routines, consiously or sub consiously, painting their own experience in their vision. What may seem as important to some is irrelevant to others and that is something that I'm still learning of course, 23 years old is far too young to have wisdom to make such large overarching statements and please realize this i just like how they sound i do not believe that i'm correct for everyone.

Anyways to put a pin in this long-winded thought process of the intermingling of my seemingly mundane tech job with my left? brain artistic passions, they can and must coexist if not be one in the same for true success in either. And it's totally possible for this to exist as a reality, because it simply always has it just takes some time to realize.
